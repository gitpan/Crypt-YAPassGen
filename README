Crypt-YAPassGen version 0.01
============================

DESCRIPTION

Crypt::YAPassGen allows you to generate pronounceable passwords using a
frequency file extracted from a dictionary of words.
This module was inspired by Crypt::PassGen written by Tim Jenness. I started
writing this module a couple of years ago, because I wasn't able to make 
Crypt::PassGen work with an Italian frequency file.
This module also offers a different interface and a few more options than
Crypt::PassGen, that's why it exists. 
Please beware that passwords generated by this module are LESS secure than
truly random passwords, so use it at your own risk!
